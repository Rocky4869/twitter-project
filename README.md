## Overview
Twitter is a microblogging and social networking site where users broadcast short posts known as “tweets”. A Tweet is any message posted to Twitter which contains a variety of formats such as photos, videos, links and text. The messages are posted to the users’ profile, sent to followers, and can be searched on Twitter search. The simplified twitter project allows registered users to post, share, like/dislike and reply to tweets with short messages, while non-registered users can only read tweets. Users can also search for other users and follow someone to subscribe to their Twitter updates. It is a powerful and beneficial system that connects people and business to cultivate a brand community and to provide real-time trends.
