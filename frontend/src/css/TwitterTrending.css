The TwitterTrending.css file contains a CSS rule for the .twittertrending class. 
This class is used to style a section of a webpage that displays Twitter trending topics.

The background-color property sets the background color of the section to aliceblue, which is a light blue color.

The border-radius property sets the rounded corners of the section to 20 pixels, giving it a more modern and visually appealing look.

The margin-bottom property adds a 5-pixel margin at the bottom of the section, creating some space between it and the content below it.

Overall, this CSS rule helps to create a clean and attractive design for the Twitter trending section on a webpage.
