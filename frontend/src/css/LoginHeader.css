Documentation by ChatGPT (modified):

The LoginHeader.css file contains styling rules for the header section of a login page. 
The .container class is used to style the container element that wraps the header content.

The display property is set to block, which means the container will take up the full width of its parent element. 
The color property is set to white, which will be the text color of the header content. 
The background-color property is set to #1da1f2, which will be the background color of the container.

The padding property is used to add space around the content inside the container. 
The font-style property is set to normal, the font-weight property is set to bold, and the font-size property is set to 48px, which will be the font size of the header text. 
The line-height property is set to 56px, which will be the height of each line of text.

The text-shadow property is used to add a shadow effect to the text. 
The transition property is used to create a smooth transition effect when the background color of the container changes on hover.

The :hover pseudo-class is used to apply the background-color property of #0d8ecf when the user hovers over the container element. 
This creates a visual feedback effect for the user.
